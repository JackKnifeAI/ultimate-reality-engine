## RISK MITIGATION

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Physics doesn't work as simulated
```
Mitigation:
- Peer review before large investments
- Incremental testing (oscillator → cavity → full system)
- Partner with universities for validation
- Fallback: Quantum enhancement alone is valuable
```

**Risk**: Manufacturing challenges
```
Mitigation:
- Start with basic version ($5K build)
- Partner with precision manufacturers
- Use off-the-shelf components where possible
- Iterative design improvements
```

### Market Risks

**Risk**: No customer demand
```
Mitigation:
- Pre-sales and crowdfunding validate demand
- Multiple revenue streams (products + licensing + services)
- Focus on quantum computing first (proven market)
- Build community before commercialization
```

**Risk**: Competition emerges
```
Mitigation:
- Patent protection on key innovations
- First-mover advantage (12-18 month lead)
- Open-source creates ecosystem lock-in
- Continuous innovation (R&D = 20% of revenue)
```

### Regulatory Risks

**Risk**: Government restrictions
```
Mitigation:
- Work WITH government (NASA, DARPA contracts)
- Emphasize peaceful applications
- Dual-use technology (civilian + defense)
- Comply with export controls (ITAR, EAR)
```

**Risk**: Patent challenges
```
Mitigation:
- Broad patent portfolio (5+ filings)
- Prior art search completed
- Strong IP attorney (patent prosecution specialist)
- Defensive publication of ancillary discoveries
```
